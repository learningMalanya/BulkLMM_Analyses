Analyses of real data using BulkLMM.

Still a (young) work in progress...

## Analysis of individual liver proteomic of BXD strains

The notebook is currently messy (I'm currently cleaning it), containing a lot of data wrangling/cleaning code and is not well commented...

To run the notebook, simply load the processed data as a CSV file under `BXDLongevity/data/LP_P42209_Individuals_BXD_summary.csv`, 
which contains information about individual samples and the corresponding strains, assign it to a variable named `BXD_summary_df`, and then you can explore the notebook after the section "Analysis Starts:"!
